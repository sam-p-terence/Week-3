    <p>In San Francisco we have the Golden Gate Park</p>
    <p>To the North, you will reach the Golden Gate Bridge</p>
    <p>To the East, you will reach the the metropolis Downtown Financial District as well as Japantown and Chinatown</p>
    <p>To the South, you will reach Pacifica</p>
    <p>To the West, you will reach Ocean Beach</p>
    <p>There are many local restaurants around the area, including Korean, Japanese, Chinese, Ethiopean, Cambodian, French, and lots of local seafood inspired restaurants.</p>
    <p>Because the city is located on the water, seafood dishes which include Dungeness crab, oyster, and various types of fish are a large cuisine within the area.</p>
